# Design
Term Project for CS-4430, Machine Learning &amp; Intelligent Agents at Cedarville University (c).
Our Term Project, *Kazoo Kart*, takes an Agent (a Kazoo Kart) and trains it to follow a track and locate the finish line using Reinforcement Learning. The Agent is set up with spatial awareness observations as well as 3D RayCasting.
