# Summary

## Requirements
This project was completed for the course CS-4430, Maching Learning & Intelligent Agents at Cedarville University (c). This is assigment is Project #3 for Spring 2021, *Train a Neural Network with Reinforcement Learning.* In this project we were to train a Neural Network with Reinforcement Learning to move the agent towards a set of collectables found on a given scene. The training was to be done useing ML-Agents ([release 12](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_12_docs)) in Unity. We were to have at least one complex Unity scene containing scenery elements, obstacles, and collectables. Both the agent and the collectables for each episode were to be randomly distributed on the map.

## Credits
This project makes ust of the [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) Git Repository. Additional dependencies include Python 3.7|3.8 and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
